My personal goal to complete at least one LeetCode Coding Challenge a day, for a year!

910. Smallest Range II
    Given an array A of integers, for each integer A[i] we need to choose either x = -K or x = K, and add x to A[i] (only once).
    After this process, we have some array B.
    Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of B and the minimum value of B.

1769. Minimum Number of Operations to Move All Balls to Each Box
    You have n boxes. You are given a binary string boxes of length n, where boxes[i] is '0' if the ith box is empty, and '1' if it contains one ball.
    In one operation, you can move one ball from a box to an adjacent box. Box i is adjacent to box j if abs(i - j) == 1. Note that after doing so, there may be more than one ball in some boxes.
    Return an array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the minimum number of operations needed to move all the balls to the ith box.
    Each answer[i] is calculated considering the initial state of the boxes.

151. Reverse Words in a String
    Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
    A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
    Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
    Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

98. Validate Binary Search Tree
    Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays 
    Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

    Example:
    Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
    Output: 2.00000
    Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

268. Missing Number  
    Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

    Example:
    Input: nums = [3,0,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

287. Find the Duplicate Number  
    Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

    Example:
    Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
    Output: 2
