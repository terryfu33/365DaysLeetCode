My personal goal to complete at least one LeetCode Coding Challenge a day, for a year!

268. Missing Number  March 14 2021
    Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

    Example:
    Input: nums = [3,0,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

    Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

    Example:
