My personal goal to complete at least one LeetCode Coding Challenge a day, for a year!

151. Reverse Words in a String
    Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
    A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
    Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
    Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

98. Validate Binary Search Tree
    Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

    Runtime: 88 ms, faster than 78.93% of JavaScript online submissions for Validate Binary Search Tree.
    Memory Usage: 42.5 MB, less than 76.13% of JavaScript online submissions for Validate Binary Search Tree.


4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays 
    Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

    Example:
    Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
    Output: 2.00000
    Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

268. Missing Number  
    Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

    Example:
    Input: nums = [3,0,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

287. Find the Duplicate Number  
    Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

    Example:
    Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
    Output: 2
