My personal goal to complete at least one LeetCode Coding Challenge a day, for a year!

4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays March 14 2021
    Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

    Example:
    Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
    Output: 2.00000
    Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

268. Missing Number  March 14 2021
    Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

    Example:
    Input: nums = [3,0,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

287. Find the Duplicate Number  March 14 2021
    Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

    Example:
    Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
    Output: 2
